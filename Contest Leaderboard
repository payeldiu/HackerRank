ou did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. 
Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. 
If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id.
Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

select h.hacker_id,name,score from hackers h,(
 select hacker_id,sum(score) score from (
 select hacker_id,challenge_id,max(score)  score
 from Submissions
 group by hacker_id,challenge_id
 )
 group by hacker_id) s
 where h.hacker_id=s.hacker_id
 and score>0
 order by score desc,h.hacker_id asc;
