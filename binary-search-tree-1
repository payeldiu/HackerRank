You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

SQL:
/*
Enter your query here.
Please append a semicolon ";" at the end of the query and enter your query in a single line to avoid error.
*/

select N,
case
when
(select count(*) from bst a where b.p is null and a.n=b.n)=1 then 'Root'
when 
(select count(*) from bst a where a.p=b.n)=0 then 'Leaf'
when 
(select count(*) from bst a where a.p=b.n)>0 then 'Inner'
end P
from BST b
order by 1;
